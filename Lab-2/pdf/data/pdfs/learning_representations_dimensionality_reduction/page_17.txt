Dimensionality Reduction using PCA 
xi 
v 
vTxi 
The eigenvalue 𝜆 denotes the amount of variability captured along 
that dimension (aka amount of energy along that dimension). 
Zero eigenvalues indicate no variability along those directions => 
data lies exactly on a linear subspace 
 
Only keep data projections onto principal components with 
non-zero eigenvalues, say v1, … , vk, where k=rank(𝑋 𝑋𝑇)

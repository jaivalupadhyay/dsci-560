Power method for computing PCs 
Given matrix 𝑋∈𝑅𝐷×𝑛, compute the top eigenvector of 𝑋 𝑋𝑇  
Initialize with random   𝑣 ∈ 𝑅𝐷 
Repeat 
v ←X XTv  
v ←v /||v || 
Claim 
Then can subtract the 𝑣  component off of each example and 
repeat to get the next. 
For any 𝜖> 0, whp over choice of initial vector, after 𝑂

iterations, we have 𝑣 𝑇𝑋𝑋𝑇𝑣 ≥1 −𝜖𝜆1.

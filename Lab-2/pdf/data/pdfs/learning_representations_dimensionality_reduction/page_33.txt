Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) 
So, 𝜆𝑖= 𝜎𝑖
2 and can read off the solution from the SVD. 
Given a matrix 𝑋∈𝑅𝐷×𝑛, the SVD is a decomposition: 𝑋𝑇= 𝑈𝑆𝑉𝑇 
Eigendecomp of 𝑋𝑋𝑇 is closely related to SVD of 𝑋.

In fact, can view the rows of 𝑈𝑆 as the coordinates of 
each example along the axes given by the 𝑑 eigenvectors.

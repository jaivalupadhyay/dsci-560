Two Interpretations 
So far: Maximum Variance Subspace. PCA finds vectors v such that 
projections on to the  vectors capture maximum variance in the data 
Alternative viewpoint:  Minimum Reconstruction Error. PCA 
finds vectors v such that projection on to the vectors yields 
minimum MSE reconstruction

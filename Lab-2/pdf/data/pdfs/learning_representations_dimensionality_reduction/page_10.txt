Principal Component Analysis (PCA) 1stPC2ndPC
Principal Components (PC) are orthogonal directions 
that capture most of the variance in the data. 
xi −v ⋅  xi 
xi 
v ⋅  xi 
•
1st PC – direction of greatest variability in data. 
•
2nd PC – Next orthogonal (uncorrelated) direction 
of greatest variability 
(remove all variability in first direction, then find next direction of 
greatest variability) 
•
And so on …

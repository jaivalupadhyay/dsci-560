Independent Component Analysis (ICA) 
𝑝𝑠1, 𝑠2, … , 𝑠𝐷= 𝑝1 𝑠1 𝑝2 𝑠2 … 𝑝𝑛𝑠𝐷 
𝒙= 𝑉∙𝒔 
Find a linear transformation 
for which coefficients 𝒔= 𝑠1, 𝑠2, … , 𝑠𝐷𝑇 are 
statistically independent 
Algorithmically, we need to identify matrix V and coefficients s, 
s.t. under the condition 𝒙= 𝑉𝑇∙𝒔 the mutual information 
between 𝑠1, 𝑠2, … , 𝑠𝐷 is minimized: 
𝐼𝑠1, 𝑠2, … , 𝑠𝐷=  𝐻𝑠𝑖 −𝐻𝑠1, 𝑠2, … , 𝑠𝐷

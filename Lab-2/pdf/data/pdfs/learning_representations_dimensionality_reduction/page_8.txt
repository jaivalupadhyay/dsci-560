Principal Component Analysis (PCA) 
In case where data  lies on or near a low d-dimensional linear 
subspace, axes of this subspace are an effective representation 
of the data. 
Identifying the axes is known as Principal Components Analysis, and 
can be obtained by using classic matrix computation tools (Eigen or 
Singular Value Decomposition).

PCA, Kernel PCA, ICA: Powerful unsupervised learning 
techniques for extracting hidden (potentially lower 
dimensional) structure from high dimensional datasets. 
Learning Representations 
Useful for: 
• Visualization  
• Further processing by machine learning algorithms 
• More efficient use of resources  
   (e.g., time, memory, communication) 
• Statistical: fewer dimensions  better generalization 
• Noise removal (improving data quality)

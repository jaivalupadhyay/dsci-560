Principal Component Analysis (PCA) 
What is PCA: Unsupervised technique for extracting 
variance structure from high dimensional datasets. 
â€¢
PCA  is an orthogonal projection or transformation  of the data 
into a (possibly lower dimensional) subspace so that the variance 
of the projected data is maximized.

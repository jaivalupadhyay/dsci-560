1stPC
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) 
Principal Components (PC) are orthogonal directions 
that capture most of the variance in the data. 
 
xi 
v 
v ⋅  xi 
• Projection of data points along first PC 
discriminates data most along any one direction 
(pts are the most spread out when we project the data on 
that direction compared to any other directions). 
||v||=1, Point xi (D-dimensional vector) 
Projection of xi onto v is  v ⋅  xi 
 
•
First PC – direction of greatest variability in data.

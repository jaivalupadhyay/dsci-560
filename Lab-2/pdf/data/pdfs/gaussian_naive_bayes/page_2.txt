Recently: 
•  Bayes classifiers to learn P(Y|X) 
•  MLE and MAP estimates for parameters of P 
•  Conditional independence 
•  Naïve Bayes à make Bayesian learning practical 
Next: 
•  Text classification 
•  Naïve Bayes and continuous variables Xi: 
•  Gaussian Naïve Bayes classifier 
•  Learn P(Y|X) directly 
•  Logistic regression, Regularization, Gradient ascent 
•  Naïve Bayes or Logistic Regression? 
•  Generative vs. Discriminative classifiers

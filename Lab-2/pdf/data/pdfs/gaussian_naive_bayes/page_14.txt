Naïve Bayes Algorithm – discrete Xi  
•  Train Naïve Bayes (examples)   
 for each value yk
 
 estimate 
 
 for each value xij of each attribute Xi
 
 
 estimate 
 
 
•  Classify (Xnew)   
 
prob that word xij appears 
in position i, given Y=yk 
 * Additional assumption:  word probabilities are position independent

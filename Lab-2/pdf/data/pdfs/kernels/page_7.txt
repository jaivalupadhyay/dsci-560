Perceptron: Mistake Bound 
Theorem: If data linearly separable by margin 𝛾 and points inside 
a ball of radius 𝑅, then Perceptron makes ≤𝑅/𝛾2 mistakes. 
(Normalized margin: multiplying all points by 100, or dividing all points by 100, 
doesn’t change the number of mistakes; algo is invariant to scaling.)

Margin: the amount of 
wiggle-room available for 
a solution.

Set t=1, start with the all zero vector 𝑤1.

•
Given example 𝑥, predict + iff 𝑤𝑡⋅𝑥≥0 
•
On a mistake, update as follows: 
•
Mistake on positive, 𝑤𝑡+1 ←𝑤𝑡+ 𝑥 
•
Mistake on negative, 𝑤𝑡+1 ←𝑤𝑡−𝑥 
Note 1:  wt is weighted sum of incorrectly classified examples 
𝑤𝑡= 𝑎𝑖1𝑥𝑖1 + ⋯+ 𝑎𝑖𝑘𝑥𝑖𝑘 
So, 𝑤𝑡⋅𝑥= 𝑎𝑖1𝑥𝑖1 ⋅𝑥+ ⋯+ 𝑎𝑖𝑘𝑥𝑖𝑘⋅𝑥

Note 2:  Number of mistakes ever made depends only on the 
geometric margin of examples seen.

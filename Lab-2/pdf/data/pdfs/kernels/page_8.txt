Perceptron Extensions 
•
Can use it to find a consistent separator with a given set 
S linearly separable by margin 𝛾 (by cycling through the data). 
•
Can convert the mistake bound guarantee into a distributional 
guarantee too (for the case where the 𝑥𝑖s come from a fixed 
distribution). 
•
Can be adapted to the case where there is no perfect 
separator as long as the so called hinge loss (i.e., the total 
distance needed to move the points to classify them correctly large 
margin) is small.  
•
Can be kernelized to handle non-linear decision boundaries!

What if Not Linearly Separable 
Problem: data not linearly separable in the most natural 
feature representation. 
Solutions: 
•
 “Learn a more complex class of functions”  
•
(e.g., decision trees, neural networks, boosting). 
•
 “Use a Kernel”  
•
 “Use a Deep Network” 
Example: 
vs 
No good linear 
separator in pixel 
representation. 
 
•
 “Combine  Kernels  and Deep Networks” 
(a neat solution that attracted a lot of attention)

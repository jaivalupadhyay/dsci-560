Set t=1, start with the all zero vector 𝑤1. 
Kernelizing  the Perceptron Algorithm 
•
Given example 𝑥, predict + iff 𝑤𝑡⋅𝑥≥0 
•
On a mistake, update as follows: 
•
Mistake on positive, 𝑤𝑡+1 ←𝑤𝑡+ 𝑥 
•
Mistake on negative, 𝑤𝑡+1 ←𝑤𝑡−𝑥 
Easy to kernelize since 𝑤𝑡 is weighted sum of incorrectly 
classified examples 𝑤𝑡= 𝑎𝑖1𝑥𝑖1 + ⋯+ 𝑎𝑖𝑘𝑥𝑖𝑘 
𝑤𝑡⋅𝑥= 𝑎𝑖1𝑥𝑖1 ⋅𝑥+ ⋯+ 𝑎𝑖𝑘𝑥𝑖𝑘⋅𝑥

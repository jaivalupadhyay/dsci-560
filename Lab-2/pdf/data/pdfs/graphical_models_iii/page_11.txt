Generating a sample from  
joint distribution: easy  
 
Note we can estimate marginals 
like P(N=n) by generating many samples 
from joint distribution, then count the fraction of samples 
for which N=n 
 
Similarly, for anything else we care about  
 P(F=1|H=1, N=0) 
 
à weak but general method for estimating any 
probability term…

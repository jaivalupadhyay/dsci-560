•  Algo does optimization over S, find hypothesis ℎ. 
•  Goal:  h has small error over D. 
•
Algo sees training sample S: (x1,c*(x1)),…, (xm,c*(xm)), xi i.i.d. from D 
– labeled examples - drawn i.i.d. from D and labeled by target c* 
–  labels 2 {-1,1}  - binary classification

X – feature/instance space; distribution D over X 
           e.g., X = Rd or X = {0,1}d

Fix hypothesis space H 
[whose complexity is not too large] 
•
Agnostic: 𝑐∗ “close to” H.

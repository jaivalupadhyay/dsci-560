Structural Risk Minimization (SRM) 
As k increases, errS h k  goes down but complex. term goes up.

𝐻1 ⊆𝐻2 ⊆𝐻3 ⊆⋯⊆𝐻𝑖⊆…  
•
 h k = argminh∈Hk{errS h } 
•
 𝑘 = argmink≥1{errS h k + complexity(Hk)} 
Output ℎ = ℎ 𝑘  
Claim: W.h.p., errD h ≤mink∗minh∗∈Hk∗errD h∗+ 2complexity Hk∗
 
Proof: 
•
We chose h  s.t. errs h + complexity Hk ≤errS h∗+ complexity(Hk∗). 
•
Whp, errD h ≤errs h + complexity Hk . 
•
Whp, errS h∗≤errD h∗+ complexity Hk∗.

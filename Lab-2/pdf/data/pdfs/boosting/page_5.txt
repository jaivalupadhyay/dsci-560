Boosting: meta-procedure that takes in an algo for finding rules 
of thumb (weak learner). Produces a highly accurate rule, by calling 
the weak learner repeatedly on cleverly chosen datasets. 
 
An Example: Spam Detection 
•
apply weak learner to a subset of emails,  obtain rule of thumb 
•
apply to 2nd subset of emails, obtain 2nd rule of thumb 
•
apply to 3rd subset of emails, obtain 3rd rule of thumb 
•
repeat T times; combine weak rules into a single highly accurate rule.

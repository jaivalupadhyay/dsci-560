Weak Learning =Strong (PAC) Learning 
Original Construction [Schapire ‚Äô89]: 
‚Ä¢
poly-time boosting algo, exploits that we can 
learn a little on every distribution. 
‚Ä¢
A modest booster obtained via calling the weak learning 
algorithm on 3 distributions. 
‚Ä¢
Cool conceptually and technically, not very practical. 
‚Ä¢
Then amplifies the modest boost of accuracy by 
running this somehow recursively.

Top Down Decision Trees Algorithms 
• 
Decision trees: if we were able to find a small decision tree 
consistent with the data, then good generalization guarantees.  
• 
NP-hard [Hyafil-Rivest’76]   
• 
Very nice practical heuristics;  top down algorithms, e.g, ID3 
• 
Natural greedy approaches where we grow the tree from the root to the 
leaves by repeatedly replacing an existing leaf with an internal node. 
• 
Key point: splitting criterion. 
• 
ID3: split the leaf that decreases the entropy the most. 
• 
Why not split according to error rate --- this is what we care 
about after all? 
• 
There are examples where we can get stuck in local minima!!!

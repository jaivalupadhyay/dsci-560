• 
Natural greedy approaches where we grow the tree from the root to the 
leaves by repeatedly replacing an existing leaf with an internal node. 
• 
Key point: splitting criterion. 
• 
ID3: split the leaf that decreases the entropy the most. 
• 
Why not split according to error rate --- this is what we care 
about after all? 
• 
There are examples where you can get stuck!!! 
Top Down Decision Trees Algorithms 
• 
[Kearns-Mansour’96]: if measure of progress is entropy, we can 
always guarantees success under some formal relationships 
between the class of splits and the target (the class of splits can 
weakly approximate the target function).   
• 
Provides a way to think about the effectiveness of 
various top down algos.

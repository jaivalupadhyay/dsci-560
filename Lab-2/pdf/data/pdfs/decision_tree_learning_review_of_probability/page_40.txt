Random Variables 
• 
Informally, A is a random variable if 
–  A denotes something about which we are uncertain 
–  perhaps the outcome of a randomized experiment  
• 
Examples 
A = True if a randomly drawn person from our class is female 
A = The hometown of a randomly drawn person from our class 
A = True if two randomly drawn persons from our class have same birthday 
 
• 
Define P(A) as “the fraction of possible worlds in which A is true” or       
“the fraction of times A holds, in repeated runs of the random experiment” 
–  the set of possible worlds is called the sample space, S 
–  A random variable A is a function defined over S 
                        A: S à {0,1}

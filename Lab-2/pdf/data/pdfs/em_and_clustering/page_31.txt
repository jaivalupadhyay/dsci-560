Bayes Nets – What You Should Know 
•  Representation 
–  Bayes nets represent joint distribution as a DAG + Conditional 
Distributions 
–  D-separation lets us decode conditional independence 
assumptions 
•  Inference 
–  NP-hard in general 
–  For some graphs, closed form inference is feasible 
–  Approximate methods too, e.g., Monte Carlo methods, … 
•  Learning 
–  Easy for known graph, fully observed data (MLE’s, MAP est.) 
–  EM for partly observed data, known graph 
–  Learning graph structure: Chow-Liu for tree-structured networks 
–  Hardest when graph unknown, data incompletely observed

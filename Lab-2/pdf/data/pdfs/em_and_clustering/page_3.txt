EM Algorithm - Informally 
EM is a general procedure for learning from partly observed data 
Given  observed variables X, unobserved Z  (X={F,A,H,N}, Z={S}) 
 
Begin with arbitrary choice for parameters θ 
Iterate until convergence: 
•  E Step: estimate the values of unobserved Z, using θ   
•  M Step: use observed values plus E-step estimates to  
                derive a better θ
Guaranteed to find local maximum. 
Each iteration increases

More generally,  
Given observed set X, unobserved set Z of boolean values 
E step:  Calculate for each training example, k  
 the expected value of each unobserved variable in  
 each training example 
   
M step: 
Calculate     similar to MLE estimates, but 
replacing each count by its expected count

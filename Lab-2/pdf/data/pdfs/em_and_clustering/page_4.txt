EM Algorithm - Precisely 
EM is a general procedure for learning from partly observed data 
Given  observed variables X, unobserved Z  (X={F,A,H,N}, Z={S}) 
Define 
Iterate until convergence: 
•  E Step: Use X and current θ to calculate P(Z|X,θ) 
•  M Step: Replace current θ by  
Guaranteed to find local maximum. 
Each iteration increases

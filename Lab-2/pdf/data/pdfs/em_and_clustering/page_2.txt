Learning of Bayes Nets 
•  Four categories of learning problems 
–  Graph structure may be known/unknown 
–  Variable values may be fully observed / partly unobserved 
•  Easy case: learn parameters for graph structure is 
known, and data is fully observed 
 
•  Interesting case: graph known, data partly known 
•  Gruesome case: graph structure unknown, data partly 
unobserved

You should know: 
•  Well posed function approximation problems: 
–  Instance space, X 
–  Sample of labeled training data { <x(i), y(i)>} 
–  Hypothesis space, H = { f: XàY } 
•  Learning is a search/optimization problem over H 
–  Various objective functions 
•  minimize training error (0-1 loss)  
•  among hypotheses that minimize training error, select smallest (?) 
•  Decision tree learning 
–  Greedy top-down learning of decision trees (ID3, C4.5, ...) 
–  Overfitting and tree/rule post-pruning 
–  Extensions… 
Questions to think about (1) 
•  ID3 and C4.5 are heuristic algorithms that 
search through the space of decision trees.  
Why not just do an exhaustive search?

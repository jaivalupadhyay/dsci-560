How can we use machine learning for 
biological and medical research? 
•  Using genotype data to build personalized 
models that can predict clinical outcomes 
•  Integrating data from multiple sources to 
perform cancer subtype analysis 
•  Structured sparse regression models for 
genome-wide association studies

•  If we want to apply machine learning 
    algorithms to BIG datasets… 
•  How can we develop parallel, low-communication machine 
learning algorithms? 
 
•  Such as embarrassingly parallel algorithms, where machines 
work independently, without communication.

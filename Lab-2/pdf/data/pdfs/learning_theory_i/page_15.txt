Sample Complexity for Supervised Learning
Consistent Learner
Example:
H is the class of conjunctions over X = 0,1 n.
E.g., h = x1 x3x5 or h = x1 x2x4𝑥9
|H| = 3n
Then 𝑚≥
1
𝜖𝑛ln 3 + ln
1
𝛿
suffice
𝑛= 10, 𝜖= 0.1, 𝛿= 0.01 then 𝑚≥156 suffice
• Output: Find h in H consistent with the sample (if one exits). 
•
Input: S: (x1,c*(x1)),…, (xm,c*(xm))

what kinds of tasks we can hope to learn, and from what kind of data; 
what are key resources involved (e.g., data, running time) 
Goals of Machine Learning Theory
Develop & analyze models to understand: 
•
prove guarantees for practically successful algs (when will they 
succeed, how long will they take?)
•
Algorithms, Probability & Statistics, Optimization, Complexity Theory, 
Information Theory, Game Theory.
Interesting tools & connections to other areas:
•
develop new algs that provably meet desired criteria (within new 
learning paradigms)

Two Core Aspects of Machine Learning
Algorithm Design. How to optimize?
Automatically generate rules that do well on observed data.
Confidence Bounds, Generalization
Confidence for rule effectiveness on future data.
Computation
•
Very well understood: Occam’s bound, VC theory, etc.
(Labeled) Data
•
E.g.: logistic regression, SVM, Adaboost, etc.
•
Note: to talk about these we need a precise model.

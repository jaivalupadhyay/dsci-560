Sample Complexity for Supervised Learning
Consistent Learner
• Output: Find h in H consistent with the sample (if one exits). 
•
Input: S: (x1,c*(x1)),…, (xm,c*(xm))
Contrapositive: if the target is in H, and we have an algo that 
can find consistent fns, then we only need this many 
examples to get generalization error ≤𝜖with prob. ≥1 −𝛿

Sample Complexity for Supervised Learning
Consistent Learner
•
𝜖is called error parameter
•
𝛿is called confidence parameter
•
there is a small chance the examples we get are not representative of 
the distribution
•
D might place low weight on certain parts of the space
• Output: Find h in H consistent with the sample (if one exits). 
•
Input: S: (x1,c*(x1)),…, (xm,c*(xm))
Bound inversely linear in 𝜖
Bound only logarithmic in |H|

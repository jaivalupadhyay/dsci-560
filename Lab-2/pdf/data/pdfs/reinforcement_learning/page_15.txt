Recursive definition for V*(S) 
assuming actions are 
chosen according to the 
optimal policy, * 
Value 𝑉∗(𝑠1) of performing optimal policy from 𝑠1, is expected reward of the first action 𝑎1 
taken plus 𝛾 times the expected value, over states 𝑠2 reached by performing action 𝑎1 
from 𝑠1, of the value 𝑉∗(𝑠2) of performing the optimal policy from then on.  
optimal value of any state s is the expected reward of performing 𝜋∗(𝑠) from s plus 
𝛾 times the expected value, over states s’ reached by performing that action from state s, 
of the optimal value of s’.

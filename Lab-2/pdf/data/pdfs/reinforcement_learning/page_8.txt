Execute actions in environment, observe results, and 
• Learn control policy : SA that maximizes                
from every state s  S 
 
Example: Robot grid world, deterministic reward r(s,a) 
 
Reinforcement Learning Task for Autonomous Agent 
•
Actions: move up, down, left, and right  
[except when you are in the top-right you stay there, and say any action that 
bumps you into a wall leaves you were you were]]  
 
•
reward fns r(s,a) is deterministic with reward 100 
for entering the top-right and 0 everywhere else.

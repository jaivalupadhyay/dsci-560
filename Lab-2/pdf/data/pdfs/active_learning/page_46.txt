Active learning with label propagation 
46 
(using soft-cuts) 
Instead, use a 1-step-lookahead heuristic: 
•
For a node with label 𝑝, assume that querying will have prob 
𝑝 of returning answer 1, 1 −𝑝 of returning answer 0. 
•
Compute “average confidence” after running soft-cut in each case: 
𝑝1
𝑛 
max 𝑓1 𝑥𝑖, 1 −𝑓1 𝑥𝑖
+ (1 −𝑝) 1
𝑛 
max 𝑓0 𝑥𝑖, 1 −𝑓0 𝑥𝑖
𝑥𝑖
𝑥𝑖
  
•
Query node s.t. this quantity is highest (you want to be more 
confident on average).

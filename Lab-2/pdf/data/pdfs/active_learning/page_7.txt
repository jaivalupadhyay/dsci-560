As in PAC/SLT, discuss algorithmic and sample complexity issues. 
•
How much unlabeled data is needed. 
• depends both on complexity of H and of compatibility notion. 
•
Ability of unlabeled data to reduce #of labeled examples. 
• compatibility of the target, helpfulness of the distrib. 
Analyze fundamental sample complexity aspects: 
A General Discriminative Model for SSL 
[BalcanBlum, COLT 2005; JACM 2010]

 Note: the mixture method that Tom talked about on Feb 25th can 
be explained from this point of view too. See the Zhu survey. 
•
Survey on “Semi-Supervised Learning” (Jerry Zhu, 2010) 
explains the SSL techniques from this point of view.

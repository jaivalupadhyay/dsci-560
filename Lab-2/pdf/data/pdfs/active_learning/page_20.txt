Active SVM/Uncertainty Sampling 
•
Works sometimes…. 
•
However, we need to be very very careful!!! 
•
Myopic, greedy technique can suffer from sampling bias. 
•
Bias created because of the querying strategy; as time goes on 
the sample is less and less representative of the true source. 
•
Main tension: want to choose informative points, but also 
want to guarantee that the classifier we output does  well on 
true random examples from the underlying distribution. 
•
Observed in practice too!!!!

Common Technique in Practice 
Uncertainty sampling in SVMs common and quite useful 
in practice. 
•
At any time during the alg., we have a “current guess” 
wt of the separator: the max-margin separator of all 
labeled points so far. 
•
Request the label of the example closest to the current 
separator. 
E.g., [Tong & Koller, ICML 2000; Jain, Vijayanarasimhan & Grauman, NIPS 2010; 
Schohon Cohn, ICML 2000]

Version Spaces. Region of Disagreement 
current version space 
Version space: part of H consistent with labels so far.

E.g.,: data lies on 
circle in R2, H = 
homogeneous 
linear seps. 
x ∈X, x ∈DIS(VS H ) iff ∃h1, h2 ∈VS(H), h1 x ≠h2(x) 
Region of disagreement = part of data space about which there 
is still some uncertainty (i.e. disagreement within version space) 
Definition (CAL’92)

in data space

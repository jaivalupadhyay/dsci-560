When Active Learning Helps. Agnostic case  
“Region of disagreement” style:  Pick a few points at random from the 
current region of disagreement, query their labels, throw out 
hypothesis if you are statistically confident they are suboptimal.  
•  C - homogeneous linear separators in Rd, 
         D - uniform,  low  noise, only d2 log (1/) labels. 
[Balcan, Beygelzimer, Langford, ICML’06]  
A2 the first algorithm which is robust to noise. 
•  C – thresholds, low noise, exponential improvement. 
[Balcan, Beygelzimer, Langford, JCSS’08]  
•  It is safe (never worse than passive learning) & exponential improvements. 
Guarantees for A2 [BBL’06,’08]: 
c* 
A lot of subsequent work.

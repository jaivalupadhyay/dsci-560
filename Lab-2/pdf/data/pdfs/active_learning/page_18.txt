Active SVM/Uncertainty Sampling 
•
Works sometimes…. 
•
However, we need to be very very very careful!!! 
•
Myopic, greedy technique can suffer from sampling bias. 
•
A bias created because of the querying strategy; as time 
goes on the sample is less and less representative of the true 
data source.

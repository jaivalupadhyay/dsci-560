Uniform Convergence 
•
 This basic result only bounds the chance that a bad hypothesis looks 
perfect on the data. What if there is no perfect h∈H (agnostic case)? 
•
What can we say if c∗∉H? 
•
 Can we say that whp all h∈H satisfy |errD(h) – errS(h)| ≤ ? 
– Called “uniform convergence”. 
– Motivates optimizing over S, even if we can’t find a 
perfect function.

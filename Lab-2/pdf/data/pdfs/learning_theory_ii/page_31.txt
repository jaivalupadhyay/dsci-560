Lower Bound (simpler form) 
•
Theorem: For any 𝐻 there exists 𝐷 such that any algorithm 
needs Ω
𝑉𝐶𝑑𝑖𝑚𝐻
𝜖
 examples to reach error 𝜖 with prob ≥3
4. 
•
Proof: consider 𝑑= 𝑉𝐶𝑑𝑖𝑚(𝐻) shattered points: 
Prob 1 −4𝜖 
Prob 4𝜖
𝑑−1 each 
•
Consider target 𝑐∗ that labels these points randomly. 
•
Unless I see roughly ½ of the rare points, have error  ≥𝜖 
•
Each example has only prob 4𝜖 of being one of the rare points, 
and need to see 𝑑−1
2  rare points, so need to see Ω
𝑑
𝜖 total.

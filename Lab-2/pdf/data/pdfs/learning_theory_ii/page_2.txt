Two Core Aspects of Machine Learning 
Algorithm Design. How to optimize? 
Automatically generate rules that do well on observed data. 
Confidence Bounds, Generalization 
Confidence for rule effectiveness on future data. 
Computation 
(Labeled) Data 
â€¢
E.g.: logistic regression, SVM, Adaboost, etc.

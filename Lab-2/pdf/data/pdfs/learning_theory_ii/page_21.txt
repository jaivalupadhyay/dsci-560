Shattering, VC-dimension 
A set of points S is shattered by H is there are hypotheses in H 
that split S in all of the 2|𝑆| possible ways, all possible ways of 
classifying points in S are achievable using concepts in H. 
Definition: 
The VC-dimension of a hypothesis space H is the cardinality of 
the largest set S that can be shattered by H. 
Definition: 
If arbitrarily large finite sets can be shattered by H, then 
VCdim(H) = ∞ 
VC-dimension (Vapnik-Chervonenkis dimension) 
H shatters S if |H S | = 2|𝑆|.

NELL:  concepts  and “noun phrases” 
SVO triples from 500 M dependency parsed web pages (thank you Chris Re!) 
-  Circumvents NELL’s fixed vocabulary of relations! 
-  Sadly, adding these does not help: too sparse 
-  But clustering verb phrases based on latent 
embedding (NNMF), produces significant 
improvement 
-  {“lies on”, “runs through”, “flows through”, …} 
-  Precision/recall over 15 NELL relations: 
 KB only:            0.80 / 0.33 
 KB + SVOlatent:  0.87 / 0.42

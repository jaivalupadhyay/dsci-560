NELL’s Approximation to EM 
E’ step: 
•  Re-estimate the knowledge base:   
–  but consider only a growing subset of the latent variable 
assignments  
–  category variables: up to 250 new NP’s per category per iteration 
–  relation variables: add only if confident and args of correct type 
–  this set of explicit latent assignments *IS* the knowledge base 
M’ step: 
•  Each view-based learner retrains itself from the updated KB 
•  “context” methods create growing subsets of contexts

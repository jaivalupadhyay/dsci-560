Generalization Guarantees 
•
Experiments showed that continuing to add new weak 
learners after correct classification of the training set had 
been achieved could further improve test set performance!!! 
•
These results seem to contradict FS’97 bound and Occam’s 
razor (in order achieve good test error the classifier should be as 
simple as possible)! 
•
Experiments showed that the test error of the generated 
classifier usually does not increase as its size becomes 
very large.

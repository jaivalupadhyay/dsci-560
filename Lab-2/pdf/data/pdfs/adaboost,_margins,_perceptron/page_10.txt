How can we explain the experiments? 
Key Idea: 
R. Schapire, Y. Freund, P. Bartlett, W. S. Lee. present in 
“Boosting the margin: A new explanation for the effectiveness 
of voting methods” a nice theoretical explanation. 
Training error does not tell the whole story.  
We need also to consider the classification confidence!!

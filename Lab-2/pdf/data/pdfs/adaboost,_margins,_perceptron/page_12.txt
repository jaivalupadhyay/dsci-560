Classification Margin 
•
H space of weak hypotheses. The convex hull of H:

Let 𝑓∈𝑐𝑜𝐻, 𝑓=  
𝛼𝑡ℎ𝑡,
𝑇
𝑡=1
𝛼𝑡≥0,   
𝛼𝑡= 1
𝑇
𝑡=1
.  
The majority vote rule 𝐻𝑓 given by 𝑓 (given by 𝐻𝑓= 𝑠𝑖𝑔𝑛(𝑓𝑥))  
predicts wrongly on example (𝑥, 𝑦) iff 𝑦𝑓𝑥≤0.

Definition: margin of 𝐻𝑓 (or of 𝑓) on example (𝑥, 𝑦) to be 𝑦𝑓(𝑥).  
𝑦𝑓𝑥= 𝑦 𝛼𝑡ℎ𝑡𝑥
=  𝑦𝛼𝑡ℎ𝑡𝑥

The margin is positive iff 𝑦= 𝐻𝑓𝑥.  
See  𝑦𝑓𝑥
= |𝑓𝑥| as the strength or the confidence of the vote. 
1 
High confidence, 
correct 
-1 
High confidence, 
incorrect 
Low confidence

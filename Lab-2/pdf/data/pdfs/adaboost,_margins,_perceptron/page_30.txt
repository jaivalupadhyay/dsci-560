Perceptron Discussion 
•
Simple online algorithm for learning linear separators with 
a nice guarantee that depends only on the geometric 
(aka 𝐿2, 𝐿2) margin. 
•
Simple, but very useful in applications like Branch 
prediction; it also has interesting extensions to 
structured prediction. 
•
It can be kernelized to handle non-linear decision 
boundaries --- see next class!

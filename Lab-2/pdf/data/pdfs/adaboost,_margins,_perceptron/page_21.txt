w 
• Instance space X = Rd 
• Hypothesis class of linear decision 
surfaces in Rd. 
•  h x = w ⋅ x + w0, if ℎ𝑥≥ 0, then 
label x as +, otherwise label it as - 
Claim: WLOG w0 = 0. 
Proof: Can simulate a non-zero threshold with a dummy input 
feature 𝑥0 that is always set up to 1. 
•
𝑥= 𝑥1, … , 𝑥𝑑→𝑥 = 𝑥1, … , 𝑥𝑑, 1  
•
w ⋅ x + w0 ≥0 iff 𝑤1, … , 𝑤𝑑, w0
⋅𝑥 ≥0 
where w = 𝑤1, … , 𝑤𝑑

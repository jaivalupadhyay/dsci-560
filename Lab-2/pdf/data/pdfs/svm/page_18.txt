Question: what if data isn’t perfectly linearly separable? 
Input: S={(x1, 𝑦1), …,(xm, 𝑦m)};  
argminw,𝜉1,…,𝜉𝑚 𝑤
2 + 𝐶 𝜉𝑖
𝑖
 s.t.: 
  •
For all i, 𝑦𝑖𝑤⋅𝑥𝑖≥1 −𝜉𝑖 
Find 
𝜉𝑖≥0 
Replace “# mistakes” with upper bound called “hinge loss” 
𝑙𝑤, 𝑥, 𝑦= max (0,1 −𝑦 𝑤⋅𝑥)

w 
𝑤⋅𝑥= −1 
𝑤⋅𝑥= 1 
Total amount have to move the points to get them 
on the correct side of the lines 𝑤⋅𝑥= +1/−1, 
where the distance between the lines 𝑤⋅𝑥= 0 and 
𝑤⋅𝑥= 1 counts as “1 unit”.

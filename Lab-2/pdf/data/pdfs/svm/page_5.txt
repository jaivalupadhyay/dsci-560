Both sample complexity and algorithmic implications. 
Margin Important Theme in ML 
Sample/Mistake Bound complexity: 
•
If large margin, # mistakes Peceptron makes 
is small (independent on the dim of the space)! 
•
If large margin 𝛾 and if alg. produces a large 
margin classifier, then amount of data needed 
depends only on R/𝛾 [Bartlett & Shawe-Taylor ’99].

Semi-supervised Learning 
Test of time 
awards at ICML! 
• Major topic of research in ML. 
• Several methods have been developed to try to use 
unlabeled data to improve performance, e.g.: 
– Transductive SVM [Joachims ’99] 
 
– Co-training [Blum & Mitchell ’98] 
 
– Graph-based methods [B&C01], [ZGL03] 
Today: discuss these methods. 
Very interesting, they all exploit unlabeled data in 
different, very interesting and creative ways.

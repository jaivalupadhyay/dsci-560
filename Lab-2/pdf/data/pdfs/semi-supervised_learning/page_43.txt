Minimum/Multiway Cut[Blum&Chawla01] 
Objective: Solve for labels on unlabeled points that minimize total 
weight of edges whose endpoints have different labels. 
•
If just two labels, can be solved 
efficiently using max-flow min-cut 
algorithms 
-
Create super-source 𝑠 connected by 
edges of weight ∞ to all + labeled pts. 
-
Create super-sink 𝑡 connected by 
edges of weight ∞ to all − labeled pts. 
-
Find minimum-weight 𝑠-𝑡 cut 
(i.e., the total weight of bad edges)

Several methods: 
– Minimum/Multiway cut [Blum&Chawla01] 
– Minimum “soft-cut” [ZhuGhahramaniLafferty’03] 
– Spectral partitioning 
– … 
Main Idea: 
•
Might have also glued together in G 
examples of different classes. 
Often, transductive approach.  (Given L + U, output predictions on 
U). Are alllowed to output any labeling of 𝐿∪𝑈. 
•
Construct graph G with edges 
between very similar examples. 
•
Run a graph partitioning algorithm to 
separate the graph into pieces.

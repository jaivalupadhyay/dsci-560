Transductive Support Vector Machines 
Optimize for the separator with large margin wrt labeled and 
unlabeled data. 
 Heuristic (Joachims) high level idea: 
Keep going until no more improvements. Finds a locally-optimal solution. 
•
First maximize margin over the labeled points 
•
Use this to give initial labels to unlabeled points 
based on this separator. 
•
Try flipping labels of unlabeled points to see if doing 
so can increase margin

Two Core Aspects of Supervised Learning 
Algorithm Design. How to optimize? 
Automatically generate rules that do well on observed data. 
Confidence Bounds, Generalization 
Confidence for rule effectiveness on future data. 
Computation 
(Labeled) Data 
•
E.g.: Naïve Bayes, logistic regression, SVM, Adaboost, etc. 
•
VC-dimension, Rademacher complexity, margin based bounds, etc.

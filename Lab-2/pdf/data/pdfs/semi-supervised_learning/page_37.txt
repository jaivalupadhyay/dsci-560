Graph-based Methods 
E.g., handwritten digits [Zhu07]: 
• Assume we are given a pairwise similarity fnc and that 
very similar examples probably have the same label. 
• If we have a lot of labeled data, this suggests a 
Nearest-Neighbor type of algorithm. 
• If you have a lot of unlabeled data, perhaps can use 
them as “stepping stones”.

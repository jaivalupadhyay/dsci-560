Smoothed analysis model 
•
Imagine a worst-case input. 
•
But then add small Gaussian perturbation to each data point. 
•
Theorem [Arthur-Manthey-Roglin 2009]:  
 
•
Might still find local opt that is far from global opt. 
-
E[number of rounds until Lloyd’s converges] if add Gaussian 
perturbation with variance 𝜎2 is polynomial in 𝑛, 1/𝜎.

The actual bound is : 𝑂

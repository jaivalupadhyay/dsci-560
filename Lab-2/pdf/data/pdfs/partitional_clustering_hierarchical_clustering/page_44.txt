Bottom-Up (agglomerative) 
•  Single linkage: 
dist A, 𝐵=
min
x∈A,x′∈B′ dist(x, x′) 
dist A, B =
avg
x∈A,x′∈B′ dist(x, x′) 
soccer

All topics 
Have a distance measure on pairs of objects. 
d(x,y) – distance between x and y 
•  Average linkage: 
•  Complete linkage: 
•  Wards’ method 
E.g., # keywords in common, edit distance, etc 
dist A, B =
max
x∈A,x′∈B′ dist(x, x′)

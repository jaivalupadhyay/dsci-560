K-means++ Idea: D2 sampling 
•
Interpolate between random and furthest point initialization 
•
Let D(x) be the distance between a point 𝑥 and its nearest 
center. Chose the next center proportional to D𝛼(𝐱). 
•
𝛼= 0, random sampling 
•
𝛼= ∞, furthest point  (Side note: it actually works well for k-center) 
•
𝛼= 2, k-means++  
Side note: 𝛼= 1, works well for k-median

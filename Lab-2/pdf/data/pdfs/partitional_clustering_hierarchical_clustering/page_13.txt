Input: A set of n datapoints 𝐱𝟏, 𝐱𝟐, … , 𝐱𝐧 in Rd 
Common Heuristic in Practice: 
The Lloyd’s method 
Repeat until there is no further change in the cost. 
•
For each j:  Cj ←{𝑥∈𝑆 whose closest center is 𝐜𝐣} 
•
For each j: 𝐜𝐣←mean of Cj 
Initialize centers 𝒄𝟏, 𝐜𝟐, … , 𝒄𝒌∈Rd and 
               clusters C1, C2, … , Ck in any way.

Input: A set of n datapoints 𝐱𝟏, 𝐱𝟐, … , 𝐱𝐧 in Rd 
Initialization  for the Lloyd’s method 
Initialize centers 𝐜𝟏, 𝐜𝟐, … , 𝐜𝐤∈Rd and 
               clusters C1, C2, … , Ck in any way. 
Repeat until there is no further change in the cost. 
•
For each j:  Cj ←{𝑥∈𝑆 whose closest center is 𝐜𝐣} 
•
For each j: 𝐜𝐣←mean of Cj 
•
Initialization is crucial (how fast it converges, quality of solution output) 
•
Discuss techniques  commonly used in practice  
•
Random centers from the datapoints (repeat a few times) 
•
K-means ++ (works well and has provable guarantees) 
•
Furthest traversal

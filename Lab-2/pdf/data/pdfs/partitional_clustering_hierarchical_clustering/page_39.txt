K-means++/ Lloyd’s Running Time 
Repeat until there is no change in the cost. 
•
For each j:  Cj ←{𝑥∈𝑆 whose closest center is 𝐜𝐣} 
•
For each j: 𝐜𝐣←mean of Cj 
Each round takes 
time O(nkd). 
•
K-means ++ initialization: O(nd) and one pass over data to 
select next center. So O(nkd) time in total. 
• Lloyd’s method 
•
Exponential # of rounds in the worst case [AV07]. 
•
Expected polynomial time in the smoothed analysis model!

Input: A set of n datapoints 𝐱𝟏, 𝐱𝟐, … , 𝐱𝐧 in Rd 
Common Heuristic: The Lloyd’s method 
Initialize centers 𝐜𝟏, 𝐜𝟐, … , 𝐜𝐤∈Rd and 
               clusters C1, C2, … , Ck in any way. 
Repeat until there is no further change in the cost. 
•
For each j:  Cj ←{𝑥∈𝑆 whose closest center is 𝐜𝐣} 
•
For each j: 𝐜𝐣←mean of Cj 
Note: it always converges. 
•
the cost always drops and  
•
there is only a finite #s of Voronoi partitions 
(so a finite # of values the cost could take)

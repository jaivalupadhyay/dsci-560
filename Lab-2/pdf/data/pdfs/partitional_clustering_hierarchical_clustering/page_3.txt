Clustering, Informal Goals 
Goal: Automatically partition unlabeled data into groups of 
similar datapoints. 
 Question: When and why would we want to do this? 
• Automatically organizing data. 
 Useful for: 
• Representing high-dimensional data in a low-dimensional space 
(e.g., for visualization purposes). 
• Understanding hidden structure in data. 
• Preprocessing for further analysis.

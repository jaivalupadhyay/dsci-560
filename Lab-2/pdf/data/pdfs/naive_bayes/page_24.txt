Naïve Bayes: Subtlety #1 
Often the Xi are not really conditionally independent 
 
•  We use Naïve Bayes in many cases anyway, and 
it often works pretty well 
–  often the right classification, even when not the right 
probability (see [Domingos&Pazzani, 1996]) 
 
•  What is effect on estimated P(Y|X)? 
–  Extreme case: what if we add two copies: Xi  = Xk

Graphical Models 
•  Key Idea:  
–  Conditional independence assumptions useful   
–  but Naïve Bayes is extreme! 
–  Graphical models express sets of conditional 
independence assumptions via graph structure 
–  Graph structure plus associated parameters define 
joint probability distribution over set of variables 
•  Two types of graphical models: 
–  Directed graphs (aka Bayesian Networks) 
–  Undirected graphs (aka Markov Random Fields)

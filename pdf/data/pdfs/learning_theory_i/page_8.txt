(x1,c*(x1)),‚Ä¶, (xm,c*(xm))
‚Ä¢
Algo sees training sample S: (x1,c*(x1)),‚Ä¶, (xm,c*(xm)), xi independently 
and identically distributed (i.i.d.) from D; labeled by ùëê‚àó
Distribution D on X(x1,‚Ä¶,xm)
‚Ä¢
Does optimization over S, finds hypothesis h (e.g., a decision tree).
‚Ä¢
Goal: h has small error over D.

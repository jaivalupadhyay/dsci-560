Sample Complexity for Supervised Learning
Consistent Learner
Example:
H is the class of conjunctions over X = 0,1 n.
• Output: Find h in H consistent with the sample (if one exits). 
•
Input: S: (x1,c*(x1)),…, (xm,c*(xm))
Side HWK question: show that any conjunction can be 
represented by a small decision tree; also by a linear 
separator.

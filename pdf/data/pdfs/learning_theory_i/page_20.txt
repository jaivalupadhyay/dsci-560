Supervised Learning: PAC model (Valiant)
• X - instance space, e.g., X = 0,1 n or X = Rn
• Sl={(xi, yi)} - labeled examples drawn i.i.d. from some 
distr. D over X and labeled by some target concept c*
– labels 2 {-1,1} - binary classification
• Algorithm A PAC-learns concept class H if for any 
target c* in H, any distrib. D over X, any , > 0:
- A uses at most poly(n,1/,1/,size(c*)) examples and running 
time.
- With probab. 1-, A produces h in H of error at · .

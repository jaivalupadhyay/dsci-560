Co-training: Theoretical Guarantees 
What properties do we need for co-training to work well? 
We need assumptions about: 
1.
the underlying data distribution 
2.
the learning algos on the two sides 
 [Blum & Mitchell, COLT ‘98] 
1.  Independence given the label 
2.  Alg. for learning from random noise. 
[Balcan, Blum, Yang, NIPS 2004] 
1. Distributional expansion. 
2.  Alg. for learning from positve data only.

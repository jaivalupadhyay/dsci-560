Common Technique in Practice 
Active SVM seems to be quite useful in practice. 
•
Find 𝑤𝑡 the max-margin 
separator of all labeled 
points so far. 
•
Request the label of the 
example closest to the current 
separator: minimizing 𝑥𝑖⋅𝑤𝑡.

Algorithm (batch version) 
Input Su={x1, …,xmu} drawn i.i.d from the underlying source D 
Start: query for the labels of a few random 𝑥𝑖s. 
For 𝒕= 𝟏, ….,

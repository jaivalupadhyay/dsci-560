Unlabeled data useful if we have a bias/belief not only about 
the form of the target, but also about its relationship with 
the underlying data distribution. 
Key Insight/Underlying Fundamental Principle 
E.g., “large margin separator” 
[Joachims ’99] 
 
Similarity based 
(“small cut”) 
[B&C01], [ZGL03] 
 
“self-consistent rules” [Blum & Mitchell ’98]

Unlabeled data can help reduce search space or re-order the fns 
in the search space according to our belief, biasing the search 
towards fns satisfying the belief (which becomes concrete once 
we see unlabeled data).

What You Should Know 
• Active learning could be really helpful, could provide 
exponential improvements in label complexity (both 
theoretically and practically)! 
•
Common heuristics (e.g., those based on uncertainty 
sampling). Need to be very careful due to  sampling bias. 
•
Safe Disagreement Based Active Learning Schemes. 
•
Understand how they operate precisely in noise 
free scenarios.

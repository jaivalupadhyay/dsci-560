• Need to choose the label requests carefully, to get 
informative labels. 
What Makes a Good Active Learning 
Algorithm? 
• Guaranteed to output a relatively good classifier 
for most learning problems. 
• Doesn’t make too many label requests. 
 
    Hopefully  a lot less than passive learning and SSL.

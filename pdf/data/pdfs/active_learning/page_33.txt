Disagreement Based Active Learning 
“Disagreement based ” algos:  query points from current 
region of disagreement, throw out hypotheses when 
statistically confident they are suboptimal.  
Lots of subsequent work trying to make is more efficient computationally 
and more aggressive too: [Hanneke07, DasguptaHsuMontleoni’07, Wang’09 , 
Fridman’09,  Koltchinskii10, BHW’08, BeygelzimerHsuLangfordZhang’10, Hsu’10, Ailon’12, …] 
•
Generic (any class), adversarial label noise. 
Still, could be suboptimal in label complex & computationally 
inefficient in general. 
 
•
Computationally efficient for classes of small VC-dimension

Can adaptive querying help? [CAL92, Dasgupta04] 
•
Threshold fns on the real line: 
w 
+ 
- 
Exponential improvement. 
 
hw(x) = 1(x ¸ w),  C = {hw: w 2 R} 
•
How can we recover the correct labels with ≪N queries? 
- 
•   Do binary search!  
Active: only O(log 1/ϵ) labels. 
Passive supervised: Ω(1/ϵ) labels to find an -accurate threshold.

Active Algorithm 
Just need O(log N) labels! 
• N = O(1/ϵ)  we are guaranteed to get a classifier of error ≤ϵ.  
•
 Get N unlabeled examples 
•
 Output a classifier consistent with the N inferred labels.

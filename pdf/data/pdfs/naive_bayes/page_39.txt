Questions: 
 
•  How can we extend Naïve Bayes if just 2 of the Xi‘s 
are dependent? 
•  What does the decision surface of a Naïve Bayes 
classifier look like? 
•  What error will the classifier achieve if Naïve Bayes 
assumption is satisfied and we have infinite training 
data? 
•  Can you use Naïve Bayes for a combination of 
discrete and real-valued Xi?

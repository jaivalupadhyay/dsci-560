Perceptron Algorithm: Analysis 
Theorem: If data has margin 𝛾 and all 
points inside a ball of radius 𝑅, then 
Perceptron makes ≤𝑅/𝛾2 mistakes. 
Update rule:  
•
Mistake on positive: 𝑤𝑡+1 ←𝑤𝑡+ 𝑥 
•
Mistake on negative: 𝑤𝑡+1 ←𝑤𝑡−𝑥 
Proof: 
Idea: analyze 𝑤𝑡⋅𝑤∗ and ‖𝑤𝑡‖, where 𝑤∗ is the max-margin sep, ‖𝑤∗‖ = 1.  
Claim 1: 𝑤𝑡+1 ⋅𝑤∗≥𝑤𝑡⋅𝑤∗+ 𝛾. 
Claim 2: 𝑤𝑡+1 2 ≤
𝑤𝑡
2 + 𝑅2. 
(because 𝑙𝑥𝑥⋅𝑤∗≥𝛾) 
(by Pythagorean Theorem) 
𝑤𝑡 
𝑤𝑡+1 
𝑥 
After 𝑀 mistakes: 
𝑤𝑀+1 ⋅𝑤∗≥𝛾𝑀 (by Claim 1) 
𝑤𝑀+1
≤𝑅𝑀 (by Claim 2) 
𝑤𝑀+1 ⋅𝑤∗≤‖𝑤𝑀+1‖  (since 𝑤∗ is unit length) 
So, 𝛾𝑀≤𝑅𝑀, so 𝑀≤
𝑅
𝛾
2
. 𝑤∗𝑤𝑀+1

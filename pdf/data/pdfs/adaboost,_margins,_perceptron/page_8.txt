Generalization Guarantees 
•
Experiments showed that the test error of the generated 
classifier usually does not increase as its size becomes 
very large. 
•
Experiments showed that continuing to add new weak 
learners after correct classification of the training set had 
been achieved could further improve test set performance!!!

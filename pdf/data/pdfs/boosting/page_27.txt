• If 𝐻𝑓𝑖𝑛𝑎𝑙 incorrectly classifies 𝑥𝑖, 
Analyzing Training Error: Proof Intuition 
- Then 𝑥𝑖 incorrectly classified by (wtd) majority of ℎ𝑡’s. 
• On round 𝑡, we increase weight of 𝑥𝑖 for which ℎ𝑡 is wrong.   
- Which implies final prob. weight of 𝑥𝑖 is large.

Since sum of prob. = 1, can’t have too many of high weight.

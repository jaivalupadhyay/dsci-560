Weak Learning vs Strong/PAC Learning 
•
[Kearns & Valiant ’88]:  defined weak learning: 
being able to predict better than random guessing 
(error ≤1
2 −𝛾) , consistently. 
•
Posed an open pb: “Does there exist a boosting algo that 
turns a weak learner into a strong PAC learner (that can 
produce arbitrarily accurate hypotheses)?” 
•
Informally, given “weak” learning algo that can consistently 
find classifiers of error ≤1
2 −𝛾, a boosting algo would 
provably construct a single classifier with error ≤𝜖.

Generalization Guarantees 
•
Experiments with boosting showed that the test error of 
the generated classifier usually does not increase as its 
size becomes very large. 
•
Experiments showed that continuing to add new weak 
learners after correct classification of the training set had 
been achieved could further improve test set performance!!! 
•
These results seem to contradict FS’87 bound and Occam’s 
razor (in order achieve good test error the classifier should be as 
simple as possible)!

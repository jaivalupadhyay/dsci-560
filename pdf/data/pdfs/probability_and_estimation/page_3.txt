P(B) 
P(A|B) = 
Bayes, Thomas (1763) An essay 
towards solving a problem in the doctrine 
of chances. Philosophical Transactions of 
the Royal Society of London, 53:370-418 
…by no means merely a curious speculation in the doctrine of chances, 
but necessary to be solved in order to a sure foundation for all our 
reasonings concerning past facts, and what is likely to be hereafter…. 
necessary to be considered by any that would give a clear account of the 
strength of analogical or inductive reasoning… 
Bayes’ rule 
we call P(A) the “prior” 
 
and P(A|B) the “posterior”

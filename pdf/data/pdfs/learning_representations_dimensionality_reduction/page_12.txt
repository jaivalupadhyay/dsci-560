Principal Component Analysis (PCA) 
X XT v = λv , so v (the first PC) is the eigenvector 
of sample correlation/covariance matrix 𝑋 𝑋𝑇 
Sample variance of projection v𝑇𝑋 𝑋𝑇v = 𝜆v𝑇v = 𝜆 
Thus, the eigenvalue 𝜆 denotes the amount of variability 
captured along that dimension (aka amount of energy along that 
dimension). 
Eigenvalues 𝜆1 ≥𝜆2 ≥𝜆3 ≥⋯ 
•
The 1st PC 𝑣1 is the the eigenvector of the sample covariance matrix 
𝑋 𝑋𝑇 associated with the largest eigenvalue  
•
The 2nd PC 𝑣2 is the the eigenvector of the sample covariance 
matrix 𝑋 𝑋𝑇 associated with the second largest eigenvalue

And so on …

Dimensionality Reduction using PCA 
In high-dimensional problems, data sometimes lies near a linear 
subspace, as noise introduces small variability 
 
Only keep data projections onto principal components with large 
eigenvalues

Can ignore the components of smaller significance.  
 
Might lose some info, but if eigenvalues are small, do not lose much

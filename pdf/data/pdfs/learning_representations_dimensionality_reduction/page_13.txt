•
Transformed features are uncorrelated. 
•
So, the new axes are the eigenvectors of the matrix of sample 
correlations 𝑋 𝑋𝑇 of the data. 
•
Geometrically: centering followed by rotation. 
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) 
– Linear transformation 
Key computation: eigendecomposition of 𝑋𝑋𝑇 (closely related 
to SVD of 𝑋).

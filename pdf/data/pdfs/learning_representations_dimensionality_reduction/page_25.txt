Alternative expression for PCA 
 
•
The principal component lies in the span of the data 
𝑣1 =  𝛼𝑘𝑥𝑖
𝑖
= 𝑋𝛼 
Why? 1st PC is direction of largest variance, and for any direction outside of 
the span of the data, only get more variance if we project that direction into 
the span.  
Only depends on 
the inner product   
matrix  
•
Plug this in we have 
𝐶𝑣1 = 1
𝑛𝑋𝑋⊤𝑋𝛼= 𝜆 𝑋𝛼  
•
Now, left-multiply the LHS and RHS by 𝑋𝑇. 
1
𝑛𝑋⊤𝑋𝑋⊤𝑋𝛼= 𝜆𝑋⊤𝑋𝛼

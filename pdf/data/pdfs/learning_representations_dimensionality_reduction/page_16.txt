Why? Pythagorean Theorem 
xi 
v 
v ⋅  xi 
blue2 + green2 = black2 
black2 is fixed (it’s just the data) 
So, maximizing blue2 is 
equivalent to minimizing green2  
Maximum Variance Direction:  1st PC a vector v such that projection 
on to this vector capture maximum variance in the data (out of all 
possible one dimensional projections) 
Minimum Reconstruction Error: 1st PC a vector v such that 
projection on to this vector yields minimum MSE reconstruction  
E.g., for the first component.

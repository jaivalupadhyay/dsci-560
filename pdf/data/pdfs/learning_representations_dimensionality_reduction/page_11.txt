Principal Component Analysis (PCA) 
Let v1, v2, …, vd denote the d principal components. 
Wrap constraints into the  
objective function 
vi ⋅ vj  = 0, i ≠ j 
Find vector that maximizes sample variance of projected data 
and vi ⋅ vi  = 1,  i =  j 
Let X = [x1, x2, … , xn] (columns are the datapoints) 
Assume data is centered (we extracted the sample mean).

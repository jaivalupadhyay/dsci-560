Two Interpretations 
Maximum Variance Direction:  1st PC a vector v such that projection 
on to this vector capture maximum variance in the data (out of all 
possible one dimensional projections) 
Minimum Reconstruction Error: 1st PC a vector v such that 
projection on to this vector yields minimum MSE reconstruction

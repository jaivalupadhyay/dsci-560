Principal Component Analysis (PCA) 
Both features are relevant  
Only one relevant feature 
Question: Can we transform the features so that we only need to 
preserve one latent feature?  
Intrinsically lower dimensional than the 
dimension of the ambient space. 
If we rotate data, again only one 
coordinate is more important.

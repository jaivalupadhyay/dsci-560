Fix h; by Hoeffding, prob. that errS h −errD h
≥ϵ is at most 2e−2mϵ2 
Hoeffding & union bound. 
•
By union bound over all ℎ∈𝐻, the prob. that ∃h s.t. errS h −errD h
≥ϵ is 
at most 2|H|e−2mϵ2. Set to . Solve. 
Fact:  
W.h.p. ≥1 −𝛿,errD ℎ ≤errD h∗+ 2ϵ, 
h  is ERM output, h∗ is hyp. of smallest 
true error rate.

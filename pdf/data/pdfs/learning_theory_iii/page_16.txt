Rademacher Complexity 
So,  taking the expectation over 𝜎 this measures the ability of 
class F to fit random noise. 
 sup measures for any given set S and Rademacher vector 𝜎, 
the max correlation between f zi  and 𝜎𝑖 for all f ∈F 
The empirical Rademacher complexity of F is:  
R m(F) = Eσ1,…,σm sup
f∈F
 1
m  σif zi
i
   
where 𝜎𝑖 are i.i.d. Rademacher variables chosen uniformly from {−1,1}.  
Rm F = ES[R m(F)] 
The Rademacher complexity of F is:  
Space Z and a distr. D|Z; F be a class of functions from Z to [0,1] 
Let S = {z1, … , zm} be i.i.d from  D|Z.

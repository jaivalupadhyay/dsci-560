Sample Complexity:  Finite Hypothesis Spaces 
Agnostic Case 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
1) How many examples suffice to get UC whp (so success for ERM).  
2) Statistical Learning Theory style: 
errD h ≤errS h +
1
2m ln (2 H ) + ln
1
𝛿
. 
With prob. at least 1 −𝛿, for all h ∈H: 
1/𝜖2 dependence [as opposed to 1/𝜖 
for realizable], but get for 
something stronger. 
1
𝑚  as opposed to 
1
𝑚  for 
realizable

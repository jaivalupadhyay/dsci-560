Techniques to Handle Overfitting 
•
Cross Validation:  
•
Structural Risk Minimization (SRM). 
•
Regularization: 
Minimize gener. bound: 
•
minimizes expressions of the form: errS h + λ h
2 
•
E.g., SVM, regularized logistic regression, etc. 
•
Hold out part of the training data and use it as a proxy for the 
generalization error 
 ℎ = argmink≥1{errS h k + complexity(Hk)} 
𝐻1 ⊆𝐻2 ⊆⋯⊆𝐻𝑖⊆…  
Some norm when H 
is a vector space; 
e.g., L2 norm 
Picked through cross validation 
general family closely related to SRM 
•
Often computationally hard….

Nice case where it is possible: M. Kearns, Y. Mansour, ICML’98, “A Fast, Bottom-Up 
Decision Tree Pruning Algorithm with Near-Optimal Generalization”

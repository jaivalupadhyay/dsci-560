E.g., 
VC bounds: distribution independent bounds  
•
Generic: hold for any concept class and any distribution. 
•
Might be very loose specific distr. that are more 
benign than the worst case…. 
•
Hold only for binary classification;  we want bounds for 
fns approximation  in general (e.g., multiclass classification and 
regression). 
[nearly tight in the WC over choice of D]

Hoeffding bounds 
Tail inequality: bound probability mass in tail of distribution (how 
concentrated is a random variable around its expectation). 
Exponentially decreasing tails 
 Consider coin of bias p flipped m times.   
Let N be the observed # heads.  Clearly E

Hoeffding Inequality 
 Let 𝛾∈[0,1]. 
[N = X1 + X2 + … + Xm, Xi = 1 with prob. p, 0 with prob 1-p.]

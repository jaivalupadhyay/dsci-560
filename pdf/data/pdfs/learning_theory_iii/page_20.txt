Rademacher Complexity Bounds 
The empirical Rademacher complexity of F is:  
R m(F) = Eσ1,…,σm sup
f∈F
 1
m  σif zi
o
   
where 𝜎𝑖 are i.i.d. Rademacher variables chosen uniformly from {−1,1}.  
Rm F = ES[R m(F)] 
The Rademacher complexity of F is:  
Space Z and a distr. D|Z; F be a class of functions from Z to [0,1] 
Let S = {z1, … , zm} be i.i.d from  D|Z.  
Data dependent bound! 
Bound expectation of each f in 
terms of its empirical average 
& the RC of F 
Proof uses Symmetrization and Ghost Sample Tricks! (same as for VC bound) 
 Whp all f ∈F satisfy: 
ED f z
≤ES f z
+ 2Rm F +
ln 2/δ
2m
 
 Theorem: 
ED f z
≤ES f z
+ 2 R m F + 3 ln 1/δ

Rademacher Complexity 
Problem Setup 
•
 F be a class of functions from Z to [0,1] 
•
 S = {z1, … , zm} be i.i.d. from  D|Z 
•
A space Z and a distr. D|Z 
 Want a high prob. uniform convergence bound, all f ∈F satisfy: 
ED f z
≤ES f z
+ term(complexity of F, niceness of D/S) 
E.g.,  Z = X × Y, Y = {−1,1}, 
 H = {h:  X →Y} hyp. space (e.g., lin. sep) 
 Then E𝑧~𝐷lh z
= errD(h) and ES lh z
= errS(h).  
F = L(H) = {lh:  X →Y}, where lh 𝑧= x, y
= 1 h x ≠𝑦  
What measure of complexity? 
[Loss fnc induced by h 
and 0/1 loss] 
  
errD h ≤errS h + term(complexity of H, niceness of D/S) 
General discrete Y

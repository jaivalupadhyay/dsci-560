K-means++ Initialization: D2 sampling [AV07] 
•
Choose 𝐜𝟏 at random. 
•
Pick 𝐜𝐣 among 𝐱𝟏, 𝐱𝟐, … , 𝐱𝐝 according to the distribution 
•
For j = 2, … , k 
•
Interpolate between random and furthest point initialization 
𝐏𝐫(𝐜𝐣= 𝐱𝐢) ∝𝐦𝐢𝐧𝐣′<𝐣 
𝐱𝐢−𝐜𝐣′
𝟐
 
•
Let D(x) be the distance between a point 𝑥 and its nearest 
center. Chose the next center proportional to D2(𝐱). 
D2(𝐱𝐢) 
Theorem: K-means++ always attains an O(log k) approximation to 
optimal k-means solution in expectation. 
Running Lloyd’s can only further improve the cost.

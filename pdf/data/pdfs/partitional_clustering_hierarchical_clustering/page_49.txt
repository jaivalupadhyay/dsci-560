Ward’s Method  
Bottom-up (agglomerative) 
•
Start with every point in its own cluster. 
•
Repeatedly merge the “closest” two clusters. 
Ward’s method: dist C, C′ =
C ⋅C′
C + C′
mean C −mean C′
2 
Merge the two clusters such that the increase in k-means cost is 
as small as possible. 
Works well in practice.

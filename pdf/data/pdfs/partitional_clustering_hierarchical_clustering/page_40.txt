K-means++/ Lloyd’s Summary 
•
Exponential # of rounds in the worst case [AV07]. 
•
Expected polynomial time in the smoothed analysis model! 
•
K-means++ always attains an O(log k) approximation to optimal 
k-means solution in expectation. 
•
Running Lloyd’s can only further improve the cost. 
•
Does well in practice.

Lloyd’s method: Performance 
•
For k equal-sized Gaussians, Pr[each initial center is in a 
different Gaussian] ≈𝑘!
𝑘𝑘≈1
𝑒𝑘 
•
Becomes unlikely as k gets large.  
•
If we do random initialization, as k increases, it becomes 
more likely we won’t have perfectly picked one center per 
Gaussian in our initialization (so Lloyd’s method will output 
a bad solution).

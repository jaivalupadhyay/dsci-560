Bottom-up (agglomerative) 
•
Start with every point in its own cluster. 
•
Repeatedly merge the “closest” two clusters.

One way to think of it: at any moment, we see connected components 
of the graph where connect any two pts of distance < r.

Watch as r grows (only n-1 relevant values because we only we merge 
at value of r corresponding to values of r in different clusters).

Generative vs. Discriminative Classifiers 
Training classifiers involves estimating f: X à Y, or P(Y|X) 
 
Generative classifiers (e.g., Naïve Bayes) 
• 
Assume some functional form for P(Y), P(X|Y)  
• 
Estimate parameters of P(X|Y), P(Y) directly from training data 
• 
Use Bayes rule to calculate P(Y=y |X= x) 
Discriminative classifiers (e.g., Logistic regression) 
• 
Assume some functional form for P(Y|X) 
• 
Estimate parameters of P(Y|X) directly from training data 
• 
NOTE: even though our derivation of the form of P(Y|X) made GNB-
style assumptions, the training procedure for Logistic Regression 
does not!

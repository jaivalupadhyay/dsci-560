A little formalism 
More formally, we have 
•  a sample space S (e.g., set of students in our class) 
–  aka the set of possible worlds 
•  a random variable is a function defined over the sample 
space 
–  Gender: S à { m, f } 
–  Height: S à Reals 
•  an event is a subset of S 
–  e.g., the subset of S for which Gender=f 
–  e.g., the subset of S for which (Gender=m) AND (eyeColor=blue) 
•  we’re often interested in probabilities of specific events 
•  and of specific events conditioned on other specific events

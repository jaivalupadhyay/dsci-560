Function Approximation: Decision Tree Learning 
Problem Setting: 
•  Set of possible instances X 
–  each instance x in X is a feature vector  
x = < x1, x2 … xn> 
•  Unknown target function f : XàY
–  Y is discrete valued 
•  Set of function hypotheses H={ h | h : XàY }
–  each hypothesis h is a decision tree 
Input: 
•  Training examples {<x(i),y(i)>} of unknown target function f
Output: 
•  Hypothesis h ∈ H that best approximates target function f

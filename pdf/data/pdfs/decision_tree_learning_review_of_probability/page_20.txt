Two Core Aspects of Machine Learning 
Algorithm Design. How to optimize? 
Automatically generate rules that do well on observed data. 
Confidence Bounds, Generalization 
Confidence for rule effectiveness on future data. 
Computation 
• 
Very well understood: Occam’s bound, VC theory, etc. 
(Labeled) Data 
• 
Decision trees: if we were able to find a small decision tree that 
explains data well, then good generalization guarantees.  
• 
NP-hard [Hyafil-Rivest’76]

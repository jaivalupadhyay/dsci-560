How can we learn Bayes Net graph structure? 
In general case, open problem 
•  can require lots of data (else high risk of overfitting) 
•  can use Bayesian methods to constrain search 
One key result: 
•  Chow-Liu algorithm: finds “best” tree-structured network   
•  What’s best? 
–  suppose P(X) is true distribution, T(X) is our tree-structured 
network, where X = <X1, … Xn>  
–  Chow-Liu minimizes Kullback-Leibler divergence:

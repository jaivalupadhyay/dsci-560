Mixture Distributions 
Model joint                     as mixture of multiple distributions. 
Use discrete-valued random var Z to indicate which 
distribution is being use for each random draw 
So 
 
 
Mixture of Gaussians: 
•  Assume each data point X=<X1, … Xn> is generated by 
one of several Gaussians, as follows: 
1.  randomly choose Gaussian i, according to P(Z=i) 
2.  randomly generate a data point <x1,x2 .. xn> according 
to N(µi, Σi)

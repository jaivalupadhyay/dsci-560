EM for Mixture of Gaussian Clustering 
Let’s simplify to make this easier:    
1. 
assume X=<X1 ... Xn>, and the Xi are conditionally independent 
given Z.   
 
 
2. 
assume only 2 clusters (values of Z), and 
3. 
Assume σ known, π1 … πK, µ1i …µKi unknown 
Observed: X=<X1 ... Xn> 
Unobserved: Z 
 
Z
X1 
X4 
X3 
X2

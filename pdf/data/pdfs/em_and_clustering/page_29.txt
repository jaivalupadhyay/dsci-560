Chow-Liu Algorithm 
1.  for each pair of vars A,B, use data to estimate P(A,B),  
P(A), P(B) 
 
2.  for each pair of vars A,B calculate mutual information 
3.  calculate the maximum spanning tree over the set of 
variables, using edge weights I(A,B) 
 (given N vars, this costs only O(N2) time) 
4.  add arrows to edges to form a directed-acyclic graph 
5.  learn the CPD’s for this graph

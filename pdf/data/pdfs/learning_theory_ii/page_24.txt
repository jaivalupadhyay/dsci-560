Shattering, VC-dimension 
If the VC-dimension is d, that means there exists a set of 
d points that can be shattered, but there is no set of d+1 
points that can be shattered. 
E.g., H= Union of k intervals on the real line 
+ 
- 
- 
VCdim H = 2k

-

+ 
- 
… 
VCdim H < 2k + 1 
VCdim H ≥2k 
            A sample of size 2k shatters 
(treat each pair of points as a 
separate case of intervals)

Effective number of hypotheses 
•
H[S] – the set of splittings of dataset S using concepts from H. 
•
H[m] - max number of ways to split m points using concepts in H 
E.g., H= Intervals on the real line

In general, |S|=m (all distinct), H m = m m+1

There are m+1 possible options for the first part, m left for the second 
part, the order does not matter, so (m choose 2) + 1 (for empty interval).

H[m] - max number of ways to split m points using concepts in H 
H m = max
S =m |H[S]| 
H[m] ≤2m

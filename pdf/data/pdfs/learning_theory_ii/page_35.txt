Hoeffding bounds 
Consider coin of bias p flipped m times.   
 Let N be the observed # heads.  Let ∈ [0,1]. 
Hoeffding bounds: 
• Pr[N/m > p + ] ≤ e-2m2, and 
• Pr[N/m < p - ] ≤ e-2m2. 
•
Tail inequality: bound probability mass in tail of 
distribution (how concentrated is a random variable 
around its expectation). 
Exponentially decreasing tails

Shattering, VC-dimension 
VCdim H < 4 
Case 1: one point inside the triangle formed by 
the others. Cannot label inside point as positive 
and outside points as negative. 
Case 2: all points on the boundary (convex hull).  
Cannot label two diagonally as positive and other 
two as negative. 
Fact: VCdim of linear separators in Rd is d+1 
E.g., H= linear separators in R2

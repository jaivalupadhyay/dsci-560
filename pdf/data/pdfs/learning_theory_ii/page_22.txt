Shattering, VC-dimension 
The VC-dimension of a hypothesis space H is the cardinality of 
the largest set S that can be shattered by H. 
Definition: 
If arbitrarily large finite sets can be shattered by H, then 
VCdim(H) = ∞ 
VC-dimension (Vapnik-Chervonenkis dimension) 
To show that VC-dimension is d: 
– there is no set of d+1 points that can be shattered. 
– there exists a set of d points that can be shattered 
Fact: If H is finite, then VCdim (H) ≤log (|H|).

Sample Complexity: Infinite Hypothesis Spaces  
B: ∃ h ∈H with errS h = 0 but errD h ≥ϵ. 
Very Very 
Rough Idea: 
B’: ∃ h ∈H with errS h = 0 but errS′ h ≥ϵ. 
S= {x1, x2, … , xm} i.i.d. from D 
S’ ={x1
′ , … , x𝑚
′ } another i.i.d. “ghost sample” from D 
Claim: To bound P(B), sufficient to bound P(B’) 
. Over S ∪S′ only H[2m] effective hypotheses left… but, no randomness left. 
•
H[m] - max number of ways to split m points using concepts in H 
Need randomness to bound the probability of a bad event, another 
symmetrization trick….

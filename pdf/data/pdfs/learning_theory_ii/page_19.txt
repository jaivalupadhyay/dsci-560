Sample Complexity: Infinite Hypothesis Spaces  
Realizable Case 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
• Not too easy to interpret sometimes hard to calculate 
exactly, but can get a good bound using “VC-dimension 
• VC-dimension is roughly the point at which H stops looking 
like it contains all functions, so hope for solving for m. 
If H m = 2m, then m ≥m
ϵ (… . )   
H[m] - max number of ways to split m points using concepts in H

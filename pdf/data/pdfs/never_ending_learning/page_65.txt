Summary 
1.  Use coupled training for semi-supervised learning 
2.  Datamine the KB to learn probabilistic inference rules 
3.  Automatically extend ontology 
4.  Use staged learning curriculum  
New directions: 
•  Self-reflection, self-estimates of accuracy (A. Platanios) 
•  Incorporate vision with NEIL (Abhinav Gupta) 
•  Microreading (Jayant Krishnamurthy, Ndapa Nakashole) 
•  Aggressive ontology expansion (Derry Wijaya) 
•  Portuguese NELL (Estevam Hrushka) 
•  never-ending learning phones?  robots?  traffic lights?

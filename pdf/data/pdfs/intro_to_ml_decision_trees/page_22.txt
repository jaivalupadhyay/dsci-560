Why Prefer Short Hypotheses? (Occam’s Razor) 
Argument in favor: 
•  Fewer short hypotheses than long ones 
à a short hypothesis that fits the data is less likely to be 
a statistical coincidence 
à highly probable that a sufficiently complex hypothesis 
will fit the data 
 
Argument opposed: 
•  Also fewer hypotheses with prime number of nodes 
and attributes beginning with “Z” 
•  What’s so special about “short” hypotheses?

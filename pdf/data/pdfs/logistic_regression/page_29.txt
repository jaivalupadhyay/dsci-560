G.Naïve Bayes vs. Logistic Regression 
Recall two assumptions deriving form of LR from GNBayes: 
1.   Xi conditionally independent of Xk given Y 
2.   P(Xi | Y = yk)  =  N(µik,σi),   ß not N(µik,σik) 
Consider three learning methods: 
• GNB (assumption 1 only)     -- decision surface can be non-linear 
• GNB2 (assumption 1 and 2) – decision surface linear 
• LR                                         -- decision surface linear, trained without  
 
 
            assumption 1. 
 
Which method works better if we have infinite training data, and... 
 
• Both (1) and (2) are satisfied: LR = GNB2 = GNB 
• (1) is satisfied, but not (2) :     GNB > GNB2, GNB > LR,  LR > GNB2  
• Neither (1) nor (2) is satisfied:   GNB>GNB2,  LR > GNB2, LR><GNB

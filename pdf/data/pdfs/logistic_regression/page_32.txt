Na√Øve Bayes vs. Logistic Regression 
The bottom line: 
 
GNB2 and LR both use linear decision surfaces, GNB need not 
 
Given infinite data, LR is better or equal to GNB2 because 
training procedure does not make assumptions 1 or 2 (though our 
derivation of the form of P(Y|X) did). 
 
But GNB2 converges more quickly to its perhaps-less-accurate 
asymptotic error 
 
And GNB is both more biased (assumption1) and less (no 
assumption 2) than LR, so either might outperform the other

•  Consider learning f: X à Y, where 
•  X is a vector of real-valued features, < X1 … Xn > 
•  Y is boolean 
•  assume all Xi are conditionally independent given Y 
•  model P(Xi | Y = yk) as Gaussian N(µik,σi) 
•  model P(Y) as Bernoulli (π) 
•  Then P(Y|X) is of this form, and we can directly estimate W 
•  Furthermore, same holds if the Xi are boolean 
•  trying proving that to yourself 
The Bottom Line

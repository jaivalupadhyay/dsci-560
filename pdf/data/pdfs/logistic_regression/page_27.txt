G.Naïve Bayes vs. Logistic Regression 
Recall two assumptions deriving form of LR from GNBayes: 
1.   Xi conditionally independent of Xk given Y 
2.   P(Xi | Y = yk)  =  N(µik,σi),   ß not N(µik,σik) 
Consider three learning methods: 
•  GNB (assumption 1 only) 
•  GNB2 (assumption 1 and 2) 
•  LR  
 
Which method works better if we have infinite training data, and… 
•  Both (1) and (2) are satisfied 
•  Neither (1) nor (2) is satisfied 
•  (1) is satisfied, but not (2)

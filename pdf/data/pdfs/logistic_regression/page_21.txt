MAP estimates and Regularization 
•  Maximum a posteriori estimate with prior W~N(0,σI) 
called a “regularization” term 
•  helps reduce overfitting 
•  keep weights nearer to zero (if P(W) is zero mean    
       Gaussian prior), or whatever the prior suggests 
•  used very frequently in Logistic Regression

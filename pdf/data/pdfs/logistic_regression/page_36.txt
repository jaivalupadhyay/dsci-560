Questions to think about: 
•  Can you use Naïve Bayes for a combination of 
discrete and real-valued Xi?  
•  How can we easily model the assumption that 
just 2 of the n attributes as dependent? 
•  What does the decision surface of a Naïve Bayes 
classifier look like? 
•  How would you select a subset of Xi’s?

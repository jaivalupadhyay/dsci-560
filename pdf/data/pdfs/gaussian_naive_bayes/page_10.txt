Learning to classify document: P(Y|X) 
the “Bag of Words” model 
•  Y discrete valued.  e.g., Spam or not 
•  X = <X1, X2, … Xn> = document 
 
•  Xi are iid random variables.  Each represents the word at its 
position i in the document 
•  Generating a document according to this distribution = 
rolling a 50,000 sided die, once for each word position in the 
document 
•  The observed counts for each word follow a ??? distribution

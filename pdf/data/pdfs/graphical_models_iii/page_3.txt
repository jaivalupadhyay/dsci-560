Bayesian Networks Definition 
A Bayes network represents the joint probability distribution 
over a collection of random variables 
 
A Bayes network is a directed acyclic graph and a set of 
conditional probability distributions (CPD’s) 
•  Each node denotes a random variable 
•  Edges denote dependencies 
•  For each node Xi its CPD defines P(Xi | Pa(Xi))
•  The joint distribution over all variables is defined to be 
Pa(X) = immediate parents of X in the graph

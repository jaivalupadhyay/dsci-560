Inference in Bayes Nets 
•  In general, intractable (NP-complete) 
•  For certain cases, tractable 
–  Assigning probability to fully observed set of variables 
–  Or if just one variable unobserved 
–  Or for singly connected graphs (ie., no undirected loops) 
•  Belief propagation 
•  Sometimes use Monte Carlo methods 
–  Generate many samples according to the Bayes Net 
distribution, then count up the results 
•  Variational methods for tractable approximate 
solutions

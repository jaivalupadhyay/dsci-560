What You Should Know 
•  Bayes nets are convenient representation for encoding 
dependencies / conditional independence 
•  BN = Graph plus parameters of CPD’s 
–  Defines joint distribution over variables 
–  Can calculate everything else from that 
–  Though inference may be intractable 
•  Reading conditional independence relations from the 
graph 
–  Each node is cond indep of non-descendents, given only its 
parents 
–  X and Y are conditionally independent given Z if Z D-separates 
every path connecting X to Y 
–  Marginal independence : special case where Z={}

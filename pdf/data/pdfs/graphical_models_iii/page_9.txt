Generating a sample from  
joint distribution: easy  
How can we generate random samples 
drawn according to P(F,A,S,H,N)? 
 
Hint: random sample of F according to P(F=1) = θF=1 : 
•  draw a value of r uniformly from [0,1] 
•  if r<θ  then output F=1, else F=0 
 
 
let’s use p(a,b) as shorthand for p(A=a, B=b)

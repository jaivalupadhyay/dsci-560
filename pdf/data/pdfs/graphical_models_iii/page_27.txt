EM and estimating   
Given observed set X, unobserved set Y of boolean values 
E step:  Calculate for each training example, k  
 the expected value of each unobserved variable Y 
M step: Calculate estimates similar to MLE, but 
replacing each count by its expected count 
letâ€™s use y(k) to indicate value of Y on kth example

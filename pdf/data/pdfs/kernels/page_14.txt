Overview of Kernel Methods 
What is a Kernel? 
A kernel K is a legal def of dot-product: i.e. there exists an 
implicit mapping Φ s.t. K(    ,     ) =Φ(    )⋅Φ(    )  
Why Kernels matter? 
•
 Many algorithms interact with data only via dot-products. 
•
So, if replace x ⋅z with K x, z  they act implicitly as if data  
was in the higher-dimensional Φ-space. 
•
If data is linearly separable by large margin in the Φ-space, 
then good sample complexity.  
E.g., K(x,y) = (x ¢ y + 1)d 
: (n-dimensional space) ! nd-dimensional space 
[Or other regularity properties for controlling the capacity.]

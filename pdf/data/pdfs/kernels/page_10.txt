Complexity of Large Margin Linear Sep. 
•
Know that in Rn we can shatter n+1 points with linear 
separators, but not n+2 points (VC-dim of linear sep is n+1). 
What if we require that the points be 
linearly separated by margin 𝛾?  
Can have at most 𝑅
𝛾
2
 points inside ball of radius R 
that can be shattered at margin 𝛾 (meaning that every 
labeling is achievable by a separator of margin 𝛾). 
•
So, large margin classifiers have smaller complexity! 
•
Less prone to overfitting!!!! 
•
Less classifiers to worry about that will look good over 
the sample, but bad over all….

Nice implications for usual distributional learning setting.

Kernels, Discussion 
•
If  all computations involving instances are in terms 
of inner products then: 
Conceptually, work in a very high diml space and the alg’s 
performance depends only on linear separability in that 
extended space. 
 Computationally, only need to modify the algo by replacing 
each x ⋅z with a K x, z . 
How to choose a kernel: 
•
Use Cross-Validation to choose the parameters, e.g., 𝜎  for 
Gaussian Kernel  K x, 𝑧= exp −
𝑥−𝑧
2
2 𝜎2   
•
Learn a good kernel; e.g.,  [Lanckriet-Cristianini-Bartlett-El Ghaoui-
Jordan’04] 
•
Kernels often encode domain knowledge (e.g., string kernels)

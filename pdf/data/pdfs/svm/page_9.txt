Support Vector Machines (SVMs) 
Directly optimize for the maximum margin separator: SVMs 
Input: S={(x1, 𝑦1), …,(xm, 𝑦m)};  
Maximize 𝛾 under the constraint:

For all i, 𝑦𝑖𝑤⋅𝑥𝑖≥𝛾 
This is a

Famous example of constrained optimization: linear programming, 
where objective fn is linear, constraints are linear (in)equalities

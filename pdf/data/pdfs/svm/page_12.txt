Support Vector Machines (SVMs) 
Directly optimize for the maximum margin separator: SVMs 
Input: S={(x1, 𝑦1), …,(xm, 𝑦m)};  
argminw 𝑤
2 s.t.: 
  
•
For all i, 𝑦𝑖𝑤⋅𝑥𝑖≥1 
This is a 
constrained 
optimization 
problem. 
•
The objective is convex (quadratic) 
•
All constraints are linear 
•
Can solve efficiently (in poly time) using standard quadratic 
programing (QP) software

Support Vector Machines (SVMs) 
Question: what if data isn’t perfectly linearly separable? 
𝑤
2 + 𝐶(# misclassifications)  
Issue 1: now have two objectives  
•
maximize margin 
•
minimize # of misclassifications. 
Ans 1: Let’s optimize their sum: minimize 
NP-hard [Guruswami-Raghavendra’06]   
where 𝐶 is some tradeoff constant.  
Issue 2: This is computationally hard (NP-hard). 
[even if didn’t care about margin and minimized # mistakes]

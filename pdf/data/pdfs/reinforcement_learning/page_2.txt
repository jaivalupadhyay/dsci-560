Overview 
•
Different from ML pbs so far: decisions we make will be 
about actions to take, such as a robot deciding which way 
to move next, which will influence what we see next.   
 
•
Our decisions influence the next example we see.  
 
•
Goal will be not just to predict (say, whether there is a 
door in front of us or not) but to decide what to do.  
 
•
Model: Markov Decision Processes.

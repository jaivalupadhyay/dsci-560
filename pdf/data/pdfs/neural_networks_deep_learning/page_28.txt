Convolutional Neural Nets for Image Recognition 
•  specialized architecture: mix different types of units, not 
completely connected, motivated by primate visual cortex 
•  many shared parameters, stochastic gradient training 
•  very successful!  now many specialized architectures for 
vision, speech, translation, …

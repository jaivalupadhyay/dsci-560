Deep Belief Networks 
•  Problem: training networks with many hidden layers 
doesn’t work very well 
–  local minima, very slow training if initialize with zero weights 
•  Deep belief networks 
–  autoencoder networks to learn low dimensional encodings  
–  but more layers, to learn better encodings

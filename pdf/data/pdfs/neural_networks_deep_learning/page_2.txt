Artificial Neural Networks to learn f: X à Y 
•  f might be non-linear function 
•  X (vector of) continuous and/or discrete vars 
•  Y (vector of) continuous and/or discrete vars 
•  Represent f by network of logistic units 
•  Each unit is a logistic function 
•  MLE: train weights of all units to minimize sum of squared 
errors of predicted network outputs 
•  MAP: train to minimize sum of squared errors plus weight 
magnitudes

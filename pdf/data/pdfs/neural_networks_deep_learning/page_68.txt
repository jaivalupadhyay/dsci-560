Artificial Neural Networks: Summary 
•  Highly non-linear regression/classification 
•  Hidden layers learn intermediate representations 
•  Potentially millions of parameters to estimate 
•  Stochastic gradient descent, local minima problems 
•  Deep networks have produced real progress in many fields 
–  computer vision 
–  speech recognition 
–  mapping images to text 
–  recommender systems 
–  … 
•  They learn very useful non-linear representations
